		<h3>gluten</h3>
		<p>Gluten is a substance that gives elasticity to dough and helps it rise. It is found in wheat, rye, barley and oats.<span class='footnote' data-toggle="tooltip" title="Hill, Margaret. 'Attack of the Gluten.'' ChemMatters, Feb. 2012, pp. 9-11.

		<div class="row sub-row" id="celiac_disease">
			<h4 id="celiac_disease">celiac disease</h4>
			<p>Celiac disease is “a condition caused by an abnormal sensitivity to <a href="#gluten">gluten</a> in the diet.” (Hill, <i>Attack of the Gluten</i>) The immune system of people with this disease mistakenly identifies parts of gliadin and glutenin—the two proteins in gluten—as “foreign” and sends out lymphocytes to destroy these foreign epitopes. When partially digested gluten enters the bloodstream from the intenstine, a series of reactions triggered by the epitopes results in the release of cykotines, leading to inflammation of the intestinal lining. This causes symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, skin rashes, and, ultimately, severe intestinal damage. However, there are many possible wheat substitutes in existence today, such as sorghum, hydroxymethylcellulose, and xantham gum.<span class='footnote' data-toggle="tooltip" title="Hill, Margaret.

		<h3>kneading</h3>
		<p>When bread dough is kneaded, the proteins are stretched out and aligned correctly with one another, which facilitates the formation of a network of hydrogen bonds within the dough.<span class='footnote' data-toggle="tooltip" title="Hill, Margaret.

		<h3>flour</h3>
		<p>The main part of the wheat flour in bread is protein; when flour is mixed with <a href="#water">water</a>, these proteins are hydrated and form <a href="#gluten">gluten</a>. All gluten proteins are dominated by hydrophobic amino acids (ex. glutamine), which makes them insoluble in water.<span class='footnote' data-toggle="tooltip" title='Royal Society of Chemistry, "Bread Chemistry: On the Rise".

		<h3>water</h3>
		<p>When <a href=”#flour”>flour</a> is mixed with water, the proteins (gliadin + glutenin) in the flour are hydrated and form <a href="#gluten">gluten</a>. Also, if instant yeast is used as the leavening agent, the water helps to re-activate the yeast fungi that were dried, preserved and made into a powder.<span class='footnote' data-toggle="tooltip" title='Nelson, Pamela.

	</div>
	<div class="row" id="salt">
		<h3>salt</h3>
		<p>The addition of salt makes for a stronger and more stable dough, as its ions (Na<sup>2+</sup>and Cl<sup>-</sup>) shield the charges of gluten and allow the molecules to get closer. Without salt, dough gets sticky and the bread is very unappetizing.<span class='footnote' data-toggle="tooltip" title='Royal Society of Chemistry, "Bread Chemistry: On the Rise". Chemistry World.

		<h3>yeast</h3>
		<p>Yeast are tiny single-celled organisms that feed on sugar in a process called <strong>fermentation</strong> to produce ethanol and carbon dioxide. The fermentation process can be summarized with this chemical equation: <span class="chemical_equation">C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> ➝ 2CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH + 2CO<sub>2</sub></span><span class='footnote' data-toggle="tooltip" title="Ibid."></span> The carbon dioxide causes the dough to increase in volume and rise; the ethanol evaporates when the bread is baked. It also contributes to the "enticing aroma" of bread.<span class='footnote' data-toggle="tooltip" title='Royal Society of Chemistry, "Bread Chemistry: On the Rise". Chemistry World.

		<div class="row sub-row" id="yeast_honey">
			<h4>yeast + honey</h4>
			<p>When a combination of yeast and honey is used in baked goods, there tends to be a higher rise due to the additional glucose. As the yeast feeds on glucose during fermentation, the addition of honey means more CO<sub>2</sub> will be produced.</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row" id="sourdough">
		<h3>sourdough starter</h3>
		<p>Instead of instant yeast, where yeast are dried and fored into a powder, with sourdough bread, sourdough yeast fungi live in a liquid medium known as a <strong>starter</strong>. Often, bakers will share starters, but many people also utilize the wild yeast in the air to create their own starters from scratch. (This is actually how the earliest bread was made -- sometimes accidentally!)<span class='footnote' data-toggle="tooltip" title='Nelson, Pamela. "How Sourdough Bread Works." <i>How Stuff Works</i>, <a href="http://science.howstuffworks.com/innovation/ 
     edible-innovations/sourdough.htm">science.howstuffworks.com/innovation/ 
     edible-innovations/sourdough.htm</a>. Accessed 1 May 2019.'></span>The acidic flavor of sourdough bread comes from lactic acid, as the starter also contains a bacteria, lactobacilli. Along with the alcohol created by the yeast, this contributes to the unique flavor of this variety of bread.<span class='footnote' data-toggle="tooltip" title='Ibid.'></span></p>
	</div>
	<div class="row" id="baking_soda">
		<h3>baking soda</h3>
		<p>This is an acid-base reaction. Baking soda reacts with an acid (in the case of my experiment I used lemon juice, also known as citric acid) to create carbon dioxide and water: <span class="chemical_equation">H<sub>3</sub>C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>O<sub>7</sub>+3HCO<sub>3</sub>− ⟶ C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>O<sub>73</sub>−+3H<sub>2</sub>O+3CO<sub>2</sub></span>.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="row" id="baking_powder">
		<h3>baking powder</h3>
		<p>Baking powder produces CO<sub>2</sub> in a way similar to <a href="#baking_soda">baking soda</a>, only it does not require the addition of a separate acid as it already contains a dry acid. It is composed of <a href="#baking_soda">baking soda</a> (sodium bicarbonate, NaHCO<sub>3</sub>) and a dry acid, usually cream of tartar (KHC<sub>4</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>6</sub>. After the addition of a water-based ingredient, these substances react to form CO<sub>2</sub> <i>(g)</i> and other products: <span class="chemical_equation">NaHCO<sub>3</sub> + KHC<sub>4</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>6</sub> → KNaC<sub>4</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>6</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O + CO<sub>2</sub></span>. There are two common types of baking powder that you can find on the shelf: single-acting and double-acting. Single-acting powder reacts to form carbon dioxide when the dough is mixed, whereas double-acting powder also makes CO2 when the mixture is heated.

			<li><strong>#3</strong>: Chemistry can be understood and described at the macroscopic (observable) level, the submicroscopic (particle) level, and the symbolic level. Making connections between these three is crucial to developing true understanding of chemical phenomena.
			</li>
			<li><strong>#5</strong>: Chemical reactions require particle collisions to occur, in the correct orientation and with sufficient energy. This means that reaction conditions can be manipulated to change the rate of the reaction.</li>
